Only the truly brave will survive 

A game I made for coworkers to play while I am away.

I have a spreadsheet with a few macros, and my coworkers will be working from that spreadsheet while I am gone. I decided it would be best to disable a few macros so they don’t break anything. Then I thought... why not have it ask a trivia question with a clever hint to the answer in the popup in the event the macro was clicked? If the answer to the question was correct, it would send a new popup that links them to this GitHub.

I am still learning JS, CSS, and HTML. I made this with the help of a tutorial on YouTube and ChatGPT. I did learn a lot about JS, and I will continue to develop my skills so I don’t need to rely so much on AI. In the meantime, if you have stumbled upon this game, please give me a few pointers. Specifically, I could not get the end game button to reset the level progression buttons. Instead, when you beat the game and start back at level one, you will be asked to start level 6 rather than level 2. Though, this may not be a bad thing at all. If I ever come back to this, maybe "level 6" could be the progression of the game, and I could add features like power-ups.

Another issue I ran into was trying to get the enemy to follow the player. I just could not work out the logic myself, and ChatGPT wasn’t much better.

I hope you like the game.
